# 🚦 Real-Time Traffic Detection System

A Python-based traffic detection system that utilizes OpenCV and YOLO (You Only Look Once) to identify and count vehicles in real-time using live or recorded video feeds.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project aims to build an intelligent system capable of detecting and tracking traffic movement to:
- Count vehicles in real-time
- Monitor traffic congestion
- Provide useful metrics for smart city infrastructure

## 🔧 Features

- Real-time object detection using YOLOv3
- Vehicle classification (car, truck, bike, bus)
- Live video or pre-recorded video support
- Bounding boxes with label overlay
- Frame-by-frame vehicle count

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **OpenCV**
- **YOLOv3**
- **NumPy**
- Pre-trained COCO weights for object detection
